## Usage Instructions (150+ words)
Using the Test Web Application is straightforward. After opening the HTML file in a web browser, you will see a simple web page with a header that contains a welcome message. The page has a responsive design, meaning it will adjust to the size of the browser window. You can test this by resizing the window and observing how the layout of the page changes.

To understand how the application works, you can inspect the code. The HTML defines the structure of the page, the CSS styles the page, and the JavaScript logs a welcome message to the console. By modifying the code, you can change the appearance and behavior of the page. For example, you can edit the CSS to change the color scheme, or add more JavaScript to introduce new functionality.

## Technical Details (100+ words)
The Test Web Application is built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, without any external libraries or frameworks. The HTML5 is used to create the structure of the web page. The CSS3, contained within style tags, styles the web page. The JavaScript, contained within script tags, logs a welcome message to the console. The application uses a responsive design, meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes. This is achieved using CSS media queries. The application also includes proper error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Troubleshooting (100+ words)
